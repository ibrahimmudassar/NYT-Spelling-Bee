## Other files
[nyt_spelling_bee_solver.py](./nyt_spelling_bee_solver.py) - this is if you want to get the NYT Spelling Bee answers without the discord webhook. Intended to be used as a skeleton for other implementations for other use cases.

[generic_spelling_bee_solver.py](./generic_spelling_bee_solver.py) - this is a generic spelling bee solver. If you have a prompt with the same center letter and surrounding letters enter it here and you'll get an answer. This can also be used for arbitrary implementations.
